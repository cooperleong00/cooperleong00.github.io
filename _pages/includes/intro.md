I am a thrid-year PhD student at [Natural Language Processing Group at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](polyunlp.github.io) (PolyU), advised by [Prof. Maggie Wenjie Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/). Before that, I received my BEng degrees from the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, in 2022.

My primary focus is on uncovering mechanistic insights to enhance the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Closely related to this, I am also passionate about the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs' general computational processes (check out [Awesome-LLM-Interpretability](https://github.com/cooperleong00/Awesome-LLM-Interpretability)!). Beyond these core areas, I have broad interests in LLM alignment, improving their reasoning capabilities, and developing more effective interactions between LLMs, humans, and the environment.
